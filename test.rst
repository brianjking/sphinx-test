Other Important Setup Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Camera should be mounted to pole **at least 10’** in the air.
-  Camera should be **perpendicular** to the pool and **optimally ~40’**
   from the pool.
-  Camera needs to be able to see from the **0’ mark out to ~40’ (all 3
   rows of calibration points)**
-  *Never leave cables out overnight or during rain. The power cables
   for the cameras can be ruined very quickly and are very difficult
   (and expensive) to replace.*

Common Issues & Possible Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You didn’t draw a Reference Line. Please re-watch the video and be
   sure you’re zooming in and setting this at the correct area & in the
   correct sequence.
-  Power cable & ethernet cables are not properly seated inside of the
   back of the camera or laptop.

New Big Air Scoring System Cameras
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  There are 2 new Big Air Scoring System Cameras that have a slightly
   different setup than the old systems. They feature Power Over
   Ethernet (PoE) which eliminates the need for a power cable to be ran
   into the back of the camera.
-  The *NEW* Big Air Scoring Camera Systems require two (2) ethernet
   cables as opposed to a single ethernet cable. The power is sourced
   from a PoE Injector, please see the diagram below for instructions on
   connecting the camera & computer together to properly pass power over
   ethernet to the camera itself.
