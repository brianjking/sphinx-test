Welcome to The Thing
========================

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
We support Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_ and `CommonMark`_.
We pull your code from your Subversion_, Bazaar_, Git_, and Mercurial_ repositories.
Then we build documentation and host it for you.
Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*.


The main documentation for the site is organized into a couple sections:

* :ref:`overview`
* :ref:`setup-club`
* :ref:`about-docs`

Information about development is also available:

* :ref:`dev-docs`
* :ref:`design-docs`
* :ref:`ops-docs`
